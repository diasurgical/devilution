# How To Play:
 - Download [the latest DevilutionX release](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/releases), or build from source
 - Copy diabdat.mpq from your CD or GoG installation (or [extract it from the GoG installer](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Extracting-the-DIABDAT.MPQ-from-the-GoG-installer)) to the DevilutionX install folder or data folder; make sure it is all lowercase. The DeviliutionX install folder is the one that contains the DevilutionX executable. The data folder path may differ depending on OS version and security settings, but will normally be as follows:
    - macOS `~/Library/Application Support/diasurgical/devilution`
    - Linux `~/.local/share/diasurgical/devilution/`
    - Windows `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\diasurgical\devilution`
 - Install [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), [SDL2_mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/) and [SDL2_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/) (included in macOS and Windows releases):
    - Ubuntu/Debian/Rasbian `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0 libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0`
 - Run `./devilutionx`

</details>
<details><summary>Windows via Visual Studio</summary>

### Installing dependencies
Make sure to install the `C++ CMake tools for Windows` component for Visual Studio.

* **Using vcpkg (recommended)**
1. Install vcpkg following the instructions from https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start.

   Don't forget to perform _user-wide integration_ step for additional convenience.
2. Install required dependencies by executing the following command (via cmd or powershell):

   For the 64-bit version of the dependencies please run this command:

   ```
   vcpkg install sdl2:x64-windows sdl2-mixer:x64-windows sdl2-ttf:x64-windows libsodium:x64-windows
   ```

   For the 32-bit version of the dependencies please run this command:

   ```
   vcpkg install sdl2:x86-windows sdl2-mixer:x86-windows sdl2-ttf:x86-windows libsodium:x86-windows
   ```

* **Manually**
1. Download and place the MSVC Development Libraries of [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), [SDL2_mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/), [SDL2_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/) and [Libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/releases) in `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\`.
2. If dependencies are not found or you wish to place them in other location - configure required path variables in _"Manage Configurations..."_ dialog inside Visual Studio or in _cmake-gui_.

### Compiling

* **Through Open->CMake in Visual Studio**
1. Go to `File -> Open -> CMake`, select `CMakeLists.txt` from the project root.
2. Select `Build devilution.exe` from the `Build` menu.

* **Through cmake-gui**

1. Input the path to devilutionx source directory at `Where is the source code:` field.
2. Input the path where the binaries would be placed at `Where to build the binaries:` field. If you want to place them inside source directory it's preferable to do so inside directory called `build` to avoid the binaries being added to the source tree.
3. It's recommended to input `Win32` in `Optional Platform for Generator`, otherwise it will default to x64 build.
4. In case you're using `vcpkg` select `Specify toolchain file for cross-compiling` and select the file `scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake` from `vcpkg` directory otherwise just go with `Use default native compilers`.
5. In case you need to select any paths to dependencies manually do this right in cmake-gui window.
6. Press `Generate` and open produced `.sln` file using Visual Studio.
7. Use build/debug etc. commands inside Visual Studio Solution like with any normal Visual Studio project.
</details>

<details><summary>Nintendo Switch</summary>
Run:

```
Packaging/switch/build.sh
```

This will install the [Switch devkit](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment) and build a DevilutionX Switch package. If you already have the devkit installed, or are on a non-Debian system, pass the the devkit path to the script like this:

```
DEVKITPRO=<path to devkit> Packaging/switch/build.sh
```

The nro-file will be generated in the build folder. Test with an emulator (RyuJinx) or real hardware.

<details><summary>Haiku</summary>

### Installing dependencies on 32 bit Haiku
```
pkgman install cmake_x86 devel:libsdl2_x86 devel:libsdl2_mixer_x86 devel:libsdl2_ttf_x86 devel:libsodium_x86
```
### Installing dependencies on 64 bit Haiku
```
pkgman install cmake devel:libsdl2 devel:libsdl2_mixer devel:libsdl2_ttf devel:libsodium
```
### Compiling on 32 bit Haiku
```
cd build
setarch x86 #Switch to secondary compiler toolchain (GCC8+)
cmake ..
cmake --build . -j $(nproc)
```
### Compiling on 64 bit Haiku
No setarch required, as there is no secondary toolchain on x86_64, and the primary is GCC8+
```
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . -j $(nproc)
```
</details>

<details><summary>OpenDingux / RetroFW</summary>

DevilutionX uses buildroot to build packages for OpenDingux and RetroFW.

The build script does the following:

1. Downloads and configures the buildroot if necessary.
2. Builds the executable (using CMake).
3. Packages the executable and all related resources into an `.ipk` or `.opk` package.

The buildroot uses ~2.5 GiB of disk space and can take 20 minutes to build.

For OpenDingux builds `mksquashfs` needs to be installed.

To build, run the following command

~~~ bash
Packaging/OpenDingux/build.sh <platform>
~~~

Replace `<platform>` with one of: `retrofw`, `rg350`, or `gkd350h`.

This prepares and uses the buildroot at `$HOME/buildroot-$PLATFORM-devilutionx`.

</details>

<details><summary>Clockwork PI GameShell</summary>

You can either call
~~~ bash
Packaging/cpi-gamesh/build.sh
~~~
to install dependencies and build the code.

Or you create a new directory under `/home/cpi/apps/Menu` and copy [the file](Packaging/cpi-gamesh/__init__.py) there. After restarting the UI, you can download and compile the game directly from the device itself. See [the readme](Packaging/cpi-gamesh/readme.md) for more details.
</details>

<details><summary><b>CMake build options</b></summary>

### General
- `-DBINARY_RELEASE=ON` changed build type to release and optimize for distribution.
- `-DNONET=ON` disable network support, this also removes the need for the ASIO and Sodium.
- `-DUSE_SDL1=ON` build for SDL v1 instead of v2, not all features are supported under SDL v1, notably upscaling.
- `-DSPAWN=ON` build the shareware version, using spawn.mpq from the original shareware; which can still be [downloaded](http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/demos/diablosw.exe) for free.
- `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../CMake/32bit.cmake` generate 32bit builds on 64bit platforms (remember to use the `linux32` command if on Linux).
- `-DCROSS_PREFIX=/path/to/prefix` set the path to the `i686-w64-mingw32` directory.

### Debug builds
- `-DDEBUG=OFF` disable debug mode of the Diablo engine.
- `-DASAN=OFF` disable address sanitizer.
- `-DUBSAN=OFF` disable undefined behavior sanitizer.

</details>

# Multiplayer
 - TCP/IP only requires the host to expose port 6112
 - UDP/IP requires that all players expose port 6112

All games are encrypted and password protected.

# Controller support

DevilutionX supports gamepad controls.

Default controller mappings (A/B/X/Y as in Nintendo layout, so the rightmost button is attack):

- Left analog or D-Pad: move hero
- A: attack nearby enemies, talk to townspeople and merchants, pickup/place items in the inventory, OK while in main menu
- B: select spell, back while in menus
- X: pickup items, open nearby chests and doors, use item in the inventory
- Y: cast spell, delete character while in main menu
- L1: use health item from belt
- R1: use mana potion from belt
- L2 or Start + Left: character sheet
- R2 or Start + Right: inventory
- Left analog click or Start + Down: toggle automap
- Start + Up or Start + Select: game menu
- Start + Left: character info
- Start + Right: inventory
- Select + A/B/X/Y: Spell hotkeys
- Right analog: move automap or simulate mouse
- Right analog click or Select + L1: left mouse click
- Select + Right analog click or Select + R1: right mouse click
- Select + L2 or Start + Y: quest log
- Select + R2 or Start + B: spell book

For now, they can be re-mapped by changing `SourceX/controls` or by setting the `SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG` environment
variable (see
[SDL_GameControllerDB](https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB)).

# F.A.Q.
> Wow, does this mean I can download and play Diablo for free now?

No, you'll need access to the data from the original game. If you don't have an original CD then you can [buy Diablo from GoG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/diablo). Alternately you can use `spawn.mpq` from the [http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/demos/diablosw.exe](shareware) version and compile the with the SPAWN flag defined.
> What game changes does DevilutionX provide

DevilutionX's main focus is to make the game work on multiple platforms. An additional goal is to make the engine mod friendly. As such, there are no changes to gameplay, but we will be making some enhancments to the engine itself. For example, the engine now has upscaling, unlocked fps, controller support, and multiplayer via TCP.
> Is 1080p supported?

Currently the game simply scales the original 640x480 to best fit, but we are working on widescreen support.
> What about Hellfire?

Hellfire is being worked on and is mostly done, though not fully playable at the moment.
> Does it work with Battle.net?

Battle.net is a service provided by Blizzard. We are not associated with them, so we have not worked on intergrating with their service.
