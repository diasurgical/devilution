# Contribution Guide

This guide outlines useful resources, tools and processes for contribution to
Devilution.

## Code style guide

[The code style guide](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilution/wiki/Code-Style) is evolving with the project.

## Useful Repos

* [diasurgical/scalpel](https://github.com/diasurgical/scalpel) - uploaded .SYM files from each release of Diablo 1 on Playstation
* [diasurgical/devilution-comparer](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilution-comparer) - small helper tool to aid comparing functions between devilution and the original binary
* [sanctuary/notes](https://github.com/sanctuary/notes) - documented Windows-specific Diablo code
* [sanctuary/psx](https://github.com/sanctuary/psx) - .SYM files converted to C headers

## Software and Utils

* A clean installation of Diablo patched to version 1.09b (Diablo.exe)
* Download IDA (Interactive Disassembler) [Hex-Rays](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware.shtml)
* Download IDC script from sanctuary/notes repository: [notes.idc](http://sanctuary.github.io/notes/notes.idc)

## How To...

Described below are steps for using the IDA and SYM files to reverse the Diablo
source.

### Understanding Devilution and Sanctuary Notes

Both Devilution and the Sanctuary Notes repo have the intended aim to get as
close as possible to document the original game. Devilution is closer in the
sense that the same names have been used for functions as based on the SYM
debug info. The notes repo has tried to use consistent naming for functions,
e.g. prefix with source file name.

See for instance [drlg_l1_load_dun](http://sanctuary.github.io/notes/#function/drlg_l1_load_dun),
which is defined in `drlg_l1.cpp`. This function has the PSX signature
`void LoadL1Dungeon__FPcii(char *sFileName, int vx, int vy)`, but is documented
in the Sanctuary Notes repo as follows for consistency:

```cpp
/// address: 0x40AE79
///
/// drlg_l1_load_dun loads tile IDs, monsters and objects from the given
/// dungeon file.
///
/// PSX ref: 0x8013CF64
/// PSX def: void LoadL1Dungeon__FPcii(char *sFileName, int vx, int vy)
void __fastcall drlg_l1_load_dun(char *dun_path, int view_x, int view_y);
```

### Interactive Disassembler Usage

* Open the `Diablo.exe` (version 1.09b in IDA) and wait for it to finish
  analysis
  * Open as "Portable Executable"
  * Processor type i386 (80386)
* Run the IDC script in IDA on the fresh IDB database to import names for
  variables and functions, type definitions, etc. (Note: run the IDC script
  **only** on new IDB databases as it removes all variable names before adding new
  ones.); for more info, see [#79 (comment)](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilution/pull/79#issuecomment-400536087)
* Example: search for `drlg_l1_load_dun`
  * Starting memory address `0x40AE79`
  * Function name `drlg_l1_load_dun`
  * Function arguments `(char *dun_path, int view_x, int view_y)`
  * #TODO what else can be inferred from below?

```asm

; dungeon file.

mov     esi, eax
xor     ecx, ecx
```

### About the SYM

The [diasurgical/scalpel](https://github.com/diasurgical/scalpel) repository includes a copy of a symbolic file that was
accidentally left on the Japanese release of Diablo on Playstation 1. The CD
contained debug information in a .SYM file, the format of which has been
reversed, so we can recover type information, variable names, etc, for the PSX
release.

* Download and open [jap_05291998.out](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diasurgical/scalpel/master/psx/symbols/jap_05291998.out)
* Example: search for `LoadL1Dungeon__FPcii`
  * Starting memory address `0x8013CF64`
  * Function name `LoadL1Dungeon`
  * Function arguments `(*char sFilename, int vx, int, vy)`
  * #TODO what else can be inferred from below?

## Comparing a function with the original exe

### Using Riivaaja

* Step 1:
https://docs.docker.com/install/
* Step 2:
Download latest devilution-comparer: https://github.com/diasurgical/devilution-comparer/releases (build from src if on Mac)
* Step 3:
Get the Diablo 1.09 exe
* Step 4:
If not on Windows Devilution-comparer requires Wine, either install Wine or use Riivaaja as a proxy (more on this later if you would like to go this route).
* Step 5:

#### To get a function for comparison

Build:
`docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/root/devilution -e MAKE_BUILD=pdb diasurgical/riivaaja`
Generate diff:
`devilution-comparer Diablo_original.exe Diablo.exe <function_name>`
You can add `--no-mem-disp` if you want a cleaner output but this can also hide valuable details
This will generate an `orig.asm` and `compare.asm` that you can compare in your favorit `diff` application, in the folder that you can the command from.

To use Riivaaja instead of installing Wine, create `wine` in your `$PATH` and add this content:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/root/devilution --entrypoint "/usr/bin/wine" diasurgical/riivaaja:stable $(basename $1) $2 $3
```

(Don't forget to also set exec permissions on the file)

### Using devilution-comparer with Wine

Install dependencies:
1. Install Wine if not on Windows (e.g. `sudo pacman -S wine`)
2. Install MS VC+ 5 + SP3 and MS VC+ 6 + SP5 + PP. (for more information see the [building instructions](https://github.com/diasurgical/devil-nightly#building-with-visual-c-6) of the readme)

Install `devililution-comparer` from release (or from source below):
1. Download and extract the latest release from https://github.com/diasurgical/devilution-comparer/releases

Or install `devililution-comparer` from source:
1. `git clone https://github.com/diasurgical/devililution-comparer`
2. `cd devililution-comparer`
3. `cargo build --release`
4. `cp cvdump.exe target/release/`
5. `cp comparer-config.toml target/release/`

Clone Devilution nightly, build and compare against the original Diablo binary:
1. `git clone https://github.com/diasurgical/devil-nightly`
2. `make MAKE_BUILD=pdb -f MakefileVC`
3. `cp /path/to/diablo-v1.09b.exe .`
4. `../devilution-comparer/target/debug/devilution-comparer diablo-v1.09b.exe Diablo.exe <function name>` (replace `<function name>` with e.g. `InitMonsterTRN`)
5. `code --diff orig.asm compare.asm` (or `diff -u orig.asm compare.asm`)

To watch build directory for changes use the `-w` command line flag:

```bash
$ ./devilution-comparer -w diablo-v1.09b.exe Diablo.exe InitMonsterTRN
Found InitMonsterTRN at 0x4322EC, size: 0x8C; orig size: 0x8C
Started watching Diablo.pdb for changes. CTRL+C to quit.
```
